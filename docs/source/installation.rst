Installation Instructions
-------------------------

The `conda` Python distribution is recommended, but you can use any Python
distribution you see fit.

**Install `conda`**

.. seealso::

    Miniconda package management system:
    https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html


1. Install `miniconda` for your operating system:
2. We recommend to create a new conda environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create -n twistpy python=3.9
    conda activate twistpy

.. note::
    We have recently moved to Python 3.9 since Python 3.7 reached end of life in June 2023.
    If you still have an older installation, we recommend to first save your old environment
    (*$conda create --name twistpy37 --clone twistpy*) then delete the old environment
    (*$conda remove --name twistpy --all*) and create a new one with Python 3.9 as described above.

3. Install the dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install obspy pandas matplotlib h5py scikit-learn spectrum

.. note:: Make sure the `twistpy` environment is active when using `TwistPy` and for all the following steps on
    this page!

**Install TwistPy**

Clone TwistPy

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/solldavid/TwistPy.git

.. code-block:: bash

    cd TwistPy
    conda activate twistpy
    pip install -e .

**Update TwistPy**

To update `TwistPy` please change to the `TwistPy` directory and run

.. code-block:: bash

    git pull

If that does not work for some reason (e.g. the `TwistPy` repository has seen local changes, ...)
please do the following

.. code-block:: bash

    git fetch origin main
    git reset --hard origin/main

.. warning:: All your local changes will be deleted!

If the `TwistPy` dependencies changed, just run

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -e .

again. Make sure the correct `conda` environment is active.
